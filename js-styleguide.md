## Guidelines

### Linting

* We use eslint to ensure a minimum base quality in the code. However, one must educate one self on the fact that the code should be readable and maintainable, not only by one self but also for future explorers. Therefore it is crucial that code in code (JSON) is formatted properly so that it is easy to debug.
  - Use common sense and take a step back from the computer. Can I read this?
* Use 2 space indentation
  - Configure your IDE to use 2 space indentation.
* Use classes where it is appropriate, for encapsulation for ex.
  - Excessive use however is not acceptable.
* Modifications to .eslintrc is to be made with extreme care, since errors made in this file could suppress important errors.
  - In other words dont touch unless you really mean it.
